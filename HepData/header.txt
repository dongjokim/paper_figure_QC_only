*title: Systematic studies of correlations between different order flow harmonics in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}=2.76$ TeV
*comment: CERN-LHC. Measurements of correlations between event-by-event fluctuations of amplitudes of anisotropic flow harmonics in nucleus-nucleus collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}=2.76$ TeV. Data was recorded in November 2010 with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The measurements are performed in the central pseudorapidity region (|$\eta$| < 0.8) and transverse momentum range 0.2 < $p_T$ < 5.0 GeV/c. The data for SC(3,2), SC(4,2), NSC(3,2) and NSC(4,2) in Figure 1 can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.17182/hepdata.74142. The lower order $v_n$ for n<4 in Figure 3 can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.17182/hepdata.72886.v2 (Table 3 and 4).
